# House Price Prediction using Machine Learning

## 1. Project Overview

This project builds a **House Price Prediction Model** using machine learning techniques.

**Goal:**  
Predict the selling price of a house based on its features such as:
- Area (sq.ft)
- Number of bedrooms
- Bathrooms
- Location
- Other available attributes in the dataset

**Objectives:**
- Understand and apply basic machine learning concepts (supervised learning, regression).
- Implement simple Linear Regression from scratch.
- Use scikit-learn to train multiple regression models:
  - Linear Regression
  - Polynomial Regression
  - Decision Tree Regressor
  - Random Forest Regressor
- Evaluate models using MAE, MSE, RMSE, and R² score.
- Visualize predictions vs actual house prices.
- Interpret model results and identify important features.
